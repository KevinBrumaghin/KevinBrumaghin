👋 Hi! I'm Kevin Brumaghin, a new front-end web developer. 👩‍💻

I first started learning web development in high school and continued through college, but I eventually pursued other job opportunities for a few years before getting back to tech.
I'm now back at it and loving it more than ever! I'm self-taught and always learning new things. 💡

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and also beginning to learn React.
I'm also a big fan of open source software, and I'm always looking for new projects to contribute to. 🤝

In my free time, I enjoy watching 🏈, playing video games 🎮, and spending time with my friends and family. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 
I love learning new things, so if you have any recommendations for books, resources, or courses, please let me know! 📚

I'm currently looking for work as a front-end web developer, so if you know of any openings, please don't hesitate to reach out. 📨

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! 😊
